This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Google Play marketplace. The information obtained can be used in the future to create your own apps.

## Introduction

In the project you will see the use of python packages, such as:
+ Pandas;
+ NumPy;
+ Matplotlib;
+ Seaborn;
+ Pyplot.

We used data from public sources, which can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) The data is found in the datasets folder.

The main goals of this project are to find:
* Explore the categories of applications;
* Evaluate the applications;
* Find out the relationship between paid and free apps;
* Analyze the user sentiment on mobile apps.
  
The dataset contains more than ten thousand mobile applications. The project consists of 11 headers. Each header introduces us to the data in sequence. We learn that the most popular categories are **_Family_** and **_Game_**. Also, that the average price per app is under `$20`. We can see that there is no high difference between paid and free apps.

At the end of the project we will use the data with user reviews and compare which mobile apps have less negativity: paid or free. Data with user feedback can be found in the datasets folder.
